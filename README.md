# Creating a Machine Learning Model for Predicting High-Value Apartments in Seoul

## :one: Project Introduction

Developing a machine learning model to predict the future status of high-value apartments in Seoul using real estate transaction data from 2017 to 2021.

- Utilizing Pandas for data preprocessing, and Matplotlib, Seaborn for data visualization
- Building various regression and classification models for apartment prices using Scikit-Learn, tuning, and selecting the best model through evaluation
- Conducting predictions on the status of high-value apartments in Seoul with the adopted model
- Technologies used
  - Pandas 1.3.5, Scikit-Learn 1.0.2, Seaborn 0.11.2
